# Data Science Projects

In this repository, I will place some of my Data Science projects, which were developed in R.

Each folder will contain the R script used to develop the machine learning model, a brief explanation of how the model was built, the dataset used on every specific project and the plots that have been developed.

The projects are organized as follows:

  1) **Regression** - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression.
  2) **Classification** - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification.
  3) **Clustering** - K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
  4) **Reinforcement Learning** - Upper Confidence Bound and Thomson Sampling.
  5) **Natural Language Processing**.
  6) **Deep Learning** - Artificial Neural Networks.
  7) **Improving the Model's Performance** - Grid Search, K-Fold Cross Validation and XGBoost
