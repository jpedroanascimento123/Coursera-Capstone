# Data Science Projects

In this repository, I will place some of my Data Science projects.

The projects are organized as follows:
  1) Developed in R:
  1a) **Regression** - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression.
  1b) **Classification** - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification.
  1c) **Clustering** - K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
  1d) **Reinforcement Learning** - Upper Confidence Bound and Thomson Sampling.
  1e) **Natural Language Processing**.
  1f) **Deep Learning** - Artificial Neural Networks.
  1g) **Improving the Model's Performance** - Grid Search, K-Fold Cross Validation and XGBoost.
  2) Developed in Python:
  2a) **Linear Regression**
  2b) **Logistic Regression**
  2c) **KNN**
